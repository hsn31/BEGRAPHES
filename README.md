# Graph & Algorithm project &mdash; INSA Toulouse

## Brice DECAESTECKER & Hichem SAHRAOUI

## Aim
This BE Graphs comes at the end of several courses, including Programming Oriented Object (POO) about basics of the Java language, Graphs and Algorithms about the Theory of the Graphs.

Using our knowledge, Eclipse, Git, Java 8 API and Junit 4, we tried to answer to the specifications.

We first realized a Dijkstra algorithm, then an extension of it. We carried out several validity tests / tests of correction with and without oracle to check and correct errors, then performance tests between Djikstra and its extension AStar. Finally, we have implemented a solution to the problem open carpool ride for two users.
